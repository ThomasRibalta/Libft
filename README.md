# Goal of Libft

Libft is a project of the 42 school, the aim of this project is to create a LIB in C with lots of functions that will be useful throughout 42. 

# Personal opinion

This project is undoubtedly the most useful for us at 42, as it allows us to review what we've seen during our pool. What's more, if you didn't see the chained list in your pool, you can discover them by doing the bonuses.
